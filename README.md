In this project, I leveraged Python to analyze data from an insurance firm and develop a predictive model for insurance charges. Here's a glimpse into the key steps taken:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored the dataset, visualizing distributions and relationships among variables. Removed duplicates and confirmed no null values, ensuring data cleanliness.
Visual Insights:
Visualized distribution of:
Gender (Sex)
Geographic Regions
Smoker vs. Non-Smoker demographics
Data Transformation: Converted categorical variables to numerical for compatibility with machine learning models.
Correlation Analysis: Investigated correlations between each feature and the target variable (insurance charges), visualizing results with a heatmap.
Feature Engineering: Engineered new features to enhance model performance.
Model Development:
Split data into training and testing sets.
Applied scaling to the data.
Utilized Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest Regressor algorithms.
Fine-tuned hyperparameters for each model to optimize performance.
Predictive Insights: Developed robust models to predict insurance charges for new customers based on collected data.
Excited about the insights gained and the predictive power achieved through this project! ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¼
